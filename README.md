# Task Manager 🚀

Welcome to **Task Manager**, a simple and efficient Java-based application to organize, track, and manage personal and work-related tasks. This project is a strong foundation for exploring object-oriented programming (OOP) principles while building something genuinely useful!

---

## ✨ Features

- Add and manage **Personal Tasks** and **Work Tasks** separately
- Track important details like deadlines and task descriptions

---

## 📂 Project Structure

- `Main.java`: Entry point of the application
- `Task.java`: Abstract class defining the blueprint for tasks
- `PersonalTask.java`: Handles personal task-specific logic
- `WorkTask.java`: Handles work task-specific logic
- `TaskManager.java`: Manages the collection of tasks and operations like adding and displaying tasks

---

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Java (100%)
- Designed with OOP best practices
- Easily extensible for new task types or features (like priorities, reminders, or persistence)

---
